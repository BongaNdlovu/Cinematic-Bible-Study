## 2026-11-12 — Audit fixes and the engineering handbook

**Why:** The November audit listed 36 findings. 29 were real problems; the other 7 were not bugs or were deliberate designs. A developer handbook was also requested, to be kept current with every change.

**What changed**

- Survey and referral figures no longer treat a missing value as "Sitting 0" (`js/shared/insights.js`).
- Switching accounts on one device no longer loses unsaved notes and progress, and never sends them to the new account (`js/shared/study-sync.js`, `js/shared/progress-sync.js`, `privacy.html`).
- Late answer checks no longer affect a sitting the reader has left (`js/study/study-app.js`).
- The question dialog survives a fast close and reopen (`js/study/task-flow.js`).
- A map tap on another year's event now flies the camera, and flights finish only on their own end (`js/map/map.js`).
- The insights report shows only the newest build (`js/insights/insights.js`).
- The gallery releases material copies on every model swap (`js/gallery/app.js`).
- The progress export survives damaged saved values (`js/study/competency.js`).
- 17 edge-case fixes across reviews, insights, Sentry, the desk, net, the focus timer, passage counting, word cards, card buttons, diagram Replay, the home carousel, gallery backgrounds and double-tap.
- Dev tooling: `start_website.bat`, `server.py` (port handling, CORS) and `wrangler.toml` (output directory).
- New tests: `tests/unit/audit-fixes.test.mjs` (8 tests).
- New documents: the `docs/engineering/` handbook, and `docs/FIX-REPORT-2026-11-12.md` (the plain-English report).

**Handbook updated:** all chapters (first version).

**Status:** written and tested locally. Not yet committed or deployed.
